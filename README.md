## Campaign finance for everyone
The Federal Election Commission (FEC) releases information to the public about
money that’s raised and spent in federal elections — that’s elections for US
President, Senate, and House of Representatives.

Are you interested in seeing how much money a candidate raised? Or spent? How
much debt they took on? Who contributed to their campaign? The FEC is the
authoritative source for that information.

betaFEC is a collaboration between [18F](http://18f.gsa.gov) and the FEC. It
aims to make campaign finance information more accessible (and understandable)
to all users.

## FEC repositories
We welcome you to explore, make suggestions, and contribute to our code.

This repository, fec-cms, houses the content management system (CMS) for
betaFEC.

- [FEC](https://github.com/18F/fec): a general discussion forum. We compile
  [feedback](https://github.com/18F/fec/issues) from betaFEC’s feedback widget
  here, and this is the best place to submit general feedback.
- [openFEC](https://github.com/18F/openfec): betaFEC’s API.
- [openFEC-web-app](https://github.com/18f/openfec-web-app): the betaFEC web
  app for exploring campaign finance data.
- [fec-style](https://github.com/18F/fec-style): shared styles and user
  interface components.
- [fec-cms](https://github.com/18F/fec-cms): the content management system
  (CMS) for betaFEC. This project uses
  [Wagtail](https://github.com/torchbox/wagtail), an open source CMS written
  in Python and built on the Django framework.

## Set up
We are always trying to improve our documentation. If you have suggestions or
run into problems please
[file an issue](https://github.com/18F/fec-cms/issues)!

### Project prerequisites
1. Ensure you have the following requirements installed:

    * Python 3.4.5 (which includes `pip` and and a built-in version of
      `virtualenv` called `pyvenv`).
    * The latest long term support (LTS) or stable release of Node.js (which
      includes `npm`).
    * PostgreSQL (the latest 9.5 release).
         * Read a [Mac OSX tutorial](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-postgresql-on-a-mac-with-homebrew-and-lunchy/).
         * Read a [Windows tutorial](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/install-postgresql/).
         * Read a [Linux tutorial](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/installation.html)
           (or follow your OS package manager).

2. Set up your Node environment — learn how to do this with our
   [Javascript Ecosystem Guide](https://pages.18f.gov/dev-environment-standardization/languages/javascript/).

3. Set up your Python environment — learn how to do this with our
   [Python Ecosystem Guide](https://pages.18f.gov/dev-environment-standardization/languages/python/).

4. Clone this repository.

### Install project dependencies
Use `pip` to install the Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Use `npm` to install JavaScript dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
### Give default user privileges to create database
If you would like your default user to create the database, alter their user role:
```bash
sudo su - postgres
psql
alter user [default_username] createdb;
\q
exit
```

### Create local databases
Before you can run this project locally, you'll need a development database:

```bash
createdb cfdm_cms_test
```

You will also need to set environmental variables:

Connection string for the local database as an
environment variable:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://:@/cfdm_cms_test
```

### Finish project setup
Once all prerequisites and dependencies are installed, you can finish the
project setup by running these commands:

```bash
npm run build
cd fec/
./manage.py migrate
./manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Running the application
In the root project folder, run:

```bash
cd fec/
./manage.py runserver
```

## Running tests
There are two kinds of tests that you can run with the project, Python tests and JavaScript tests.

To run the JavaScript tests, run this command in the root project directory:

```bash
npm run test-single
```

*Note: You may be prompted to allow `node` to accept connections; this is okay and required for the tests to run.*

To run the Python tests, run these commands in the root project directory:

```bash
cd fec/
./manage.py test
```

It's necessary to specify the Postgresql URL, which can be done on the
command line, e.g.:

```bash
env DATABASE_URL=postgresql://:@/cfdm_cms_test ./manage.py test
```

## Enabling/toggling features
[settings/base.py](https://github.com/18F/fec-cms/blob/develop/fec/fec/settings/base.py)
includes a set of `FEATURES` which can also be enabled using environment flags:

```bash
FEC_FEATURE_LEGAL=1 python fec/manage.py runserver
```

## Additional local development instructions

### Watch for static asset changes
To watch for changes to .js and .scss, run this command in the root project
directory:

```bash
npm run watch
```

### Developing with fec-style (optional)
If you're developing with a local instance of
[FEC-Style](https://github.com/18F/fec-style) and want to pull in styles and
script changes as you go, use `npm link` to create a symbolic link to your
local fec-style repo:

```bash
cd ~/fec-style
npm link
cd ~/openFEC-web-app
npm link fec-style
```

After linking fec-style, `npm run watch` will rebuild on changes to your local
copy of fec-style's .scss and .js files.

### Developing with openFEC (optional)
To set the URL for the web app as an environment variable, run:

```bash
export FEC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Or, to set it in the settings file directly, include this line:

```python
FEC_APP_URL = 'http://localhost:3000'
```

## Restoring your local database from a backup
*Likely only useful for 18F FEC team members*
To restore your local database from a backup from production, download the database dump and run this command:

`pg_restore --dbname cfdm_cms_test --no-acl --no-owner <path/to/backup_file>`

## Deploy
*Likely only useful for 18F FEC team members*

We use Travis for automated deploys after tests pass. If you want to deploy something it is much better to push an empty commit with a tag than doing a manual deploy.

If there is a problem with Travis and something needs to be deployed, you can do so with the following commands. Though, you will need to pull the environment variables from the space you are deploying to and remake your static assets. That will ensure things like the links are correct. You will also want to clear your dist/ directory. That way, you will not exceed the alloted space.

Before deploying, install the
[Cloud Foundry CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html)
and the [autopilot plugin](https://github.com/concourse/autopilot):

```bash
cf install-plugin autopilot -r CF-Community
```

Provision development database:

```bash
cf create-service rds micro-psql fec-rds-stage
```

Provision credentials service:

```bash
cf cups cms-creds-dev -p '{"DJANGO_SECRET_KEY": "..."}'
```

To deploy to Cloud Foundry, run `invoke deploy`. The `deploy` task will
attempt to detect the appropriate Cloud Foundry space based the current
branch; to override, pass the optional `--space` flag:

```bash
invoke deploy --space feature
```

The `deploy` task will use the `FEC_CF_USERNAME` and `FEC_CF_PASSWORD`
environment variables to log in.  If these variables are not provided, you
will be prompted for your Cloud Foundry credentials.

Deploys of a single app can be performed manually by targeting the env/space,
and specifying the corresponding manifest, as well as the app you want, like
so:

```bash
cf target -s [feature|dev|stage|prod] && cf push -f manifest_<[feature|dev|stage|prod]>.yml [api|web]
```

**NOTE:**  Performing a deploy in this manner will result in a brief period of
downtime.

## Backup
To restore data from a remote instance to a local instance, or between local
instances, back up data using `dumpdata` and restore using `loaddata`.  You'll
also need to [install cf-ssh](https://docs.cloud.gov/getting-started/cf-ssh/).
The following is an example of restoring remote data to a local instance.

Use `cf target -s` to select the space you want to create a manifest for, then:

```bash
# Local
cf create-app-manifest cms -p manifest_ssh.yml
cf-ssh -f manifest_ssh.yml

# Remote
cd fec
./manage.py dumpdata --settings fec.settings.production --exclude sessions.session --exclude contenttypes.ContentType --exclude auth.permission --exclude auth.user --output dump.json

# Local
cd fec/
cf files cms-ssh app/fec/dump.json | tail -n +4 > dump.json
./manage.py loaddata dump.json
```
