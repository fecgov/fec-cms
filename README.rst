Campaign finance for everyone
=============================
The Federal Election Commission (FEC) releases information to the public about money that’s raised and spent in federal elections — that’s elections for US president, Senate, and House of Representatives.

Are you interested in seeing how much money a candidate raised? Or spent? How much debt they took on? Who contributed to their campaign? The FEC is the authoritative source for that information.

betaFEC is a collaboration between `18F <http://18f.gsa.gov>`_ and the FEC. It aims to make campaign finance information more accessible (and understandable) to all users.

FEC repositories
================
We welcome you to explore, make suggestions, and contribute to our code.

This repository, `fec-cms <https://github.com/18F/fec-cms>`_: the content management system (CMS) for betaFEC.

All repositories
----------------
- `FEC <https://github.com/18F/fec>`_: a general discussion forum. We compile `feedback <https://github.com/18F/fec/issues>`_ from betaFEC’s feedback widget here, and this is the best place to submit general feedback.
- `openFEC <https://github.com/18F/openfec>`_: betaFEC’s API
- `openFEC-web-app <https://github.com/18f/openfec-web-app>`_: the betaFEC web app for exploring campaign finance data
- `fec-style <https://github.com/18F/fec-style>`_: shared styles and user interface components
- `fec-cms <https://github.com/18F/fec-cms>`_: the content management system (CMS) for betaFEC. This project uses `Wagtail <https://github.com/torchbox/wagtail>`_, an open source CMS written in Python and built on the Django framework.

Set up
======

Installation
------------

Install PostgreSQL.

On Mac OS: ::

    brew install postgres

On Ubuntu: ::

    apt-get install postgres

Install dependencies: ::

    npm install
    npm install -g gulp
    pip install -U -r requirements.txt

Set up
------

.. code::

    npm run build
    ./manage.py makemigrations
    ./manage.py migrate
    ./manage.py createsuperuser

Developing with fec-style (optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're developing with a local instance of `FEC-Style <https://github.com/18F/fec-style>`_ and want to pull in styles and script changes as you go, use `npm link` to create a symbolic link to your local fec-style repo: ::

    npm link fec-style > ~/[path to fec-style]/fec-style


Developing with openFEC (optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Environment variable: ::

    export FEC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

Settings: ::

    FEC_APP_URL = 'http://localhost:3000'

Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`settings.py <https://github.com/18F/fec-cms/blob/develop/fec/fec/settings/base.py>`_ includes a set of ``FEATURES`` which can be enabled using environment flags or via ``settings.local``. ::

    FEC_FEATURE_LEGAL=1 python fec/manage.py runserver


Run
---

.. code::

    ./manage.py runserver

Deploy
------

*Likely only useful for 18F team members*

Before deploying, install the [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) and the [autopilot plugin](https://github.com/concourse/autopilot): ::

    cf install-plugin autopilot -r CF-Community

Provision development database: ::

    cf create-service rds micro-psql fec-rds-stage

Provision credentials service: ::

    cf cups cms-creds-dev -p '{"DJANGO_SECRET_KEY": "..."}'

To deploy to Cloud Foundry, run ``invoke deploy``. The ``deploy`` task will attempt to detect the appropriate
Cloud Foundry space based the current branch; to override, pass the optional `--space` flag: ::

    invoke deploy --space feature

The ``deploy`` task will use the ``FEC_CF_USERNAME`` and ``FEC_CF_PASSWORD`` environment variables to log in.
If these variables are not provided, you will be prompted for your Cloud Foundry credentials.

Deploys of a single app can be performed manually by targeting the env/space, and specifying the corresponding manifest, as well as the app you want, like so: ::

    cf target -s [feature|dev|stage|prod] && cf push -f manifest_<[feature|dev|stage|prod]>.yml [api|web]

**NOTE:**  Performing a deploy in this manner will result in a brief period of downtime.


Backup
------

To restore data from a remote instance to a local instance, or between local instances, back up data using `dumpdata` and restore using `loaddata`. You'll also need to `install cf-ssh <https://docs.cloud.gov/getting-started/cf-ssh/>`_. The following is an example of restoring remote data to a local instance: ::

Use `cf target` to slect the space you want to create a manifest for, then:

    # Local
    cf create-app-manifest cms -p manifest_ssh.yml
    cf-ssh -f manifest_ssh.yml

    # Remote
    cd fec
    ./manage.py dumpdata --settings fec.settings.production --exclude sessions.session --exclude contenttypes.ContentType --exclude auth.permission --exclude auth.user --output dump.json

    # Local
    cd fec
    cf files cms-ssh app/fec/dump.json | tail -n +4 > dump.json
    ./manage.py loaddata dump.json
