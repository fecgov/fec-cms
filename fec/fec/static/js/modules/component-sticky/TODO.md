* Fix blurring on some sizes

* Make animations for mutually exclusive

* Test IE8 empty dataset

* Make mode within stacks

* Fix two-stack behaviour: stack, that is lower, should continue movement as if it is in exclusive mode with top element (pre-sticky). Now it saves a gap, not sticking to the top.

* Make mutual-exclusive zones of scrolling (0-60%, 60%-100%)
* Test smooth appearing and disappearing

* Find how to get better mobile experience (too sluggish)

* Fix yandex direct issues

* Habrahabr-like mobile mode (shows when target has passed)

* Debug scrolling. Now fails on some contents.
* Debug yandex direct. Now shits on init.
