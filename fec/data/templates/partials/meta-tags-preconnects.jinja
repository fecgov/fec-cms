{#- ==================================================
preconnect and dns-prefetch tags are included for Production.

If there's a new third-party service, add a preconnect here,
but try to make it conditional so we aren't asking for connections we won't use.

A preconnect is disconnected if isn't used in 10 seconds;
if a page generally takes longer than 10 seconds, don't waste a preconnect.
Save preconnects for blockers and higher-priority sources.

dns-prefetch only does the lookup but is currently more widely supported (as of 2021-03).
